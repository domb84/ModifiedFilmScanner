## üì¶ Firmware Dumping Instructions

1. **Install the CH341A Driver**  
   Download and install `CH341PAR.exe`.

2. **Detect Chipset**  
   Use `CH341A_CH347 Programmer V2.21` to auto-detect the chipset.

3. **Select Flash Chip**  
   Choose `MX25L3206E` as the target chip.

4. **Read and Verify ROM**  
   - Read the ROM and save the dump in a safe location.
   - Capture the ROM twice and perform a verify operation to ensure integrity.

## üìù Firmware Notes

- Create a folder named `uengmode` on the SD card to trigger the device to flash with a JPEG and configuration file.
- Create a file named `engmode` on the SD card and it will boot straight to the film adjustment. It shows "Film type:8MM" compared to the normal scren.
- The camera firmware file must be named `FWDV180N.BIN` and placed on the SD card for flashing.
- The NT96650 firmware starts at hex offset `0x00004000` (matches the runcamhd header).
- Modifying the bitrate to more than 14800 seems to crash the capture before it starts
- Flashing the firmware seems to set the language back to Chinese. To set it back. Power the machine on, wait for it to show the frame, press menu once, then press down 6 times, then press OK. That should be the language menu.
- You should be able to configure the capture by adding a DCTCONFIG.bin to the SDCARD.
- You can create a DCTCONFIG.bin file here https://app.runcam.com/tool/setting?configId=86eadd10825c0c103b49b999eaa92f58. 
- This generates a binary file prefixed and suffixed with Roral008. This is referenced just before DCTCONFIG.bin. For the M127 this seems to be ANEKA001.
- Replacing Roral008 with ANEKA001 creates a flashable config file which updates the config

I inadvertently dumped the following file when playing with various configuration files. This would appear to have dumped the possible values and supported parameters. I've not yet recreated this.
